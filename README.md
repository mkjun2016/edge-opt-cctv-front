### Technology Sections
- FPS Calculation and Display

Required Additions
---
- mAP (mean Average Precision) Calculation and Display

- This analysis goes beyond merely proving "it's fast" to demonstrating "it's fast and usable." The lab prioritizes models that can solve real-world problems, not just models that are fast.

### Add a Technical Background Explanation Page
- **INT8 Quantization:** Provide a simple explanation of the principle behind "why does converting to 8-bit integers (INT8) speed up the process?"

- **Model Pruning:** Add an explanation of "how does removing unnecessary neurons or connections affect a model's performance?"

- Mention the referenced paper (code and theoretical explanation)

What is your main priority for this project's README file: making the technical details easy for a broad audience to understand, or being very precise for a more technical audience?
